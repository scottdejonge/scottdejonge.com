## Products

I'm currently a Staff Software Engineer working with the [Hireup](https://hireup.com.au) team to ensure an accessible and performant experience for participates of the [NDIS](https://www.ndis.gov.au/) find support workers.

## Websites

I've enabled companies to connect with users on the web with responsive, meaningful, and engaging experiences. Creating human-centric, content-first experiences for a wide-range of clients from the arts, non-profit & community organisations, financial institutions, and business ranging in all shapes and sizes.
