## Education 

Bachelor of Multimedia Design - University of Queensland (2012)

## Experience

I am constantly learning and bettering my skills; always excited to further develop my understanding of inclusive web design and development. I help people communicate effectively on the web with simple and intuitive websites that users love.

### Strategy

I believe the best outcomes are created with a strategy that fundamentally understands user requirements and objectives, considering all constraints including: privacy, security, internationalisation, and search engine optimisation. 

### Design

My love of good design is central to delivering great outcomes. I create and implement design systems that provide color palettes, typography, photography, and iconography, and the creation of user interfaces which are simple and intuitive to use.

### Technical

The best design outcomes on the web are ultimately delivered through their technical implantation. I have extensive experience with a full-stack of web technologies, and a primary focus: creating accessible web experiences that are simple and intuitive to view and maintain.

### Business

In addition to my strategy, design, and technical skills, I have extensive experience working with businesses to effectively communicate the benefits of the web to their objectives. I have started a business, managed a business, and most-recently worked closely with businesses as a web service provider.
